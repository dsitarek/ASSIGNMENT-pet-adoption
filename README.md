# Adoption Website

Pet adoption website. I created a node that uses flexbox, and a card template. I then looped through the array of pet objects and rendered them to the DOM. Next I hard coded filter buttons and created filter functions to filter the items rendered to the dom by pet type. I then added a delete button and function. I also added a function that loops through the pet objects array and adds a unique ID attribute to each one. The delete function uses the unique ID attribute to find the index of the pet and remove it from the array and the DOM.
